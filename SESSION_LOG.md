## Log

### 2025-09-11
- **Step**: Ran initial `scripts/test_gui.py` created without auto-close.  
- **Result**: FAIL  
- **Details**: GUI launched but terminal froze; Ctrl+C did not release.  
- **Adjustment**: Added auto-close timer to GUI and ensured log writing.

- **Step**: Moved project root to `~/code/drone-ingestor/` and confirmed folder visibility in VS Code.  
- **Result**: SUCCESS  
- **Details**: Explorer now shows full directory tree (`config`, `logs`, `scripts`, etc.).  
- **Adjustment**: Lock all future commands to this root.

- **Step**: Downloaded and ran updated `test_gui.py` with auto-close.  
- **Result**: SUCCESS  
- **Details**: GUI launched, auto-closed after 5 seconds, log file updated.  
- **Adjustment**: Adopt pattern of always including clean exit strategies in GUI code.

- **Step**: Downloaded and attempted to run `test_gui_v2.py`.  
- **Result**: FAIL  
- **Details**: File was misnamed as `test_g ui_v2.py` (hidden space in filename) when generated by assistant. Python could not locate it.  
- **Adjustment**: Rename file to `test_gui_v2.py` with `mv "scripts/test_g ui_v2.py" scripts/test_gui_v2.py`. All future file generations must be verified for exact naming before download.

### 2025-09-12
- **Step**: Connected Bernard to repo; created and ran access test.
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: scripts/access_test.py wrote to logs/access_test.log; terminal output confirmed.
- **Adjustment**: None.

- **Step**: Hardened ingest workflow to match guardrails (logging mirror, error strings, checksums, idempotency).
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: file_ingest.py now mirrors stdoutâ†’logs/ingest.log, lists /Volumes on errors, writes checksums.txt, and skips by size+sha256.
- **Adjustment**: None.

- **Step**: Added VS Code tasks and Makefile targets (verify, improved logs; GUI launch options).
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: One-click tasks for Detect/Ingest/Logs/Start Session; Makefile verify/logs; gui_hb target.
- **Adjustment**: None.

- **Step**: Added --dest flag for external drive ingest; verified copy to NVMe.
- **Result**: SUCCESS
- **Details**: Ingest wrote to /Volumes/1T storage drive/ingests; progress and DONE logged; idempotent skips observed.
- **Adjustment**: None.
